<h1>Project Description:</h1>

The aim of this project is to extract text information from business cards using the EasyOCR library in Python. The project utilizes image processing techniques to read the business card images, which are then passed to the OCR engine for text extraction. The extracted text is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis and manipulation.

<h1>Project Goals:</h1>

- Develop a Python script to extract text from business cards using the EasyOCR library
- Clean and preprocess the business card images for optimal OCR performance
- Implement text extraction using the EasyOCR library and save the results to a CSV file
- Optimize the OCR engine for improved accuracy and efficiency 

<h1>Deliverables:</h1>

- Python script for extracting text from business cards using the EasyOCR library
- Cleaned and preprocessed business card images
- CSV file containing the extracted text information from the business cards
